# GETTING STARTED

## PART1-A Dockerizing the MongoDB Service

```bash
$ docker run --name mongodb --rm -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
$ sudo node app.js  # run the node app locally
$ docker logs mongdb # check connection
# "'Node.js v15.11.0, LE (unified)","version":"3.6.1|5.10.3"
```

## PART2-A Dockerizing the Node App

- In order to connect node-app running on locally to containerized mongodb use `mongodb://localhost:27017/course-goals` and publish the ports of mongodb container by `-p 27017:27017`

- In order to connect dockerized node-app to containerized mongodb use `mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/course-goals`. That's because, `localhost` will refer to the host of the container itself in this setup which should be replaced by the host of your system. In order to be able to resolve to localhost of your system, use `host.docker.internal` and publish the ports of mongodb container by `-p 27017:27017`.

So update app code for connection string.

```js
mongoose.connect(
  // 'mongodb://localhost:27017/course-goals',
  "mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/course-goals",
  // ...
```

```bash
$ docker build -t node-app-image .
$ docker run --name node-backend --rm -d -p 80:80 node-app-image
```

## PART3-A Dockerizing the React App

- In order to connect react-app running locally to a containerized node-app use `http://PUBLIC-IP/goals/` and publish the ports of node-backend container by `-p 80:80`

- In order to connect dockerized react-app to containerized node-app there is **no need to use** `http://host.docker.internal/goals/`. React App will not be running on a container but on your browser which can communicate directly with the localhost of your system. Therefore `localhost` within app code will not refer to the host of the container itself but to the the host of your system. There's no need for additional resolution in this case, but you'll still need to publish the ports of node-backend container by `-p 80:80`

```bash
$ docker build -t react-app-image .
## REACT Apps will require -it flag
$ docker run --name react-frontend --rm -d -p 3000:3000 -it react-app-image
```

# USING DOCKER NETWORKS

So far all communication is possible through localhost machine by publishing ports, there's no cross container communication yet

## Create Networks

```bash
$ docker network create fullstack-webapp-network
$ docker network ls
```

## PART1-B Use Docker Networks for MongoDB Container

```bash
$ docker run --name mongodb --rm -d --network fullstack-webapp-network mongo
# use volumes and environment variables
## FULL-FINAL VERSION MONGODB
$ docker run --name mongodb \
-v data:/data/db \
--rm -d \
--network fullstack-webapp-network \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=buraku \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password \
mongo
```

## PART2-B Docker Networks for Node-Backend Container

- Previously in order to connect dockerized node-app to containerized mongodb we had used `mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/course-goals` and we had to publish ports to enable communication through local system.

- Now in order to connect dockerized node-app to containerized mongodb within same network we will use `mongodb://container-name:27017/course-goals` and there will be no need to publish a port for communication through local system.

So update app code for connection string.

```js
mongoose.connect(
  // 'mongodb://localhost:27017/course-goals',
  // "mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/course-goals",
  "mongodb://mongodb:27017/course-goals",
```

- Finally we'll need to enable environment variables in Dockerfile and use them in app code for a secure connection

```js
mongoose.connect(
  `mongodb://${process.env.MONGODB_USERNAME}:${process.env.MONGODB_PASSWORD}@mongodb:27017/course-goals?authSource=admin`,
```

```bash
$ docker build -t node-app-image .
# use networks in order to connect containerized node-app to containerized mongodb
# use volumes and environment variables
## FULL-FINAL VERSION NODE-BACKEND
$
docker run --name node-backend \
-v logs:/home/node/app/logs \
-v $(pwd):/home/node/app \
-v /home/node/app/node_modules \
-e MONGODB_USERNAME=buraku \
-e MONGODB_PASSWORD=password \
--rm -d \
--network fullstack-webapp-network \
-p 80:80 \
node-app-image
```

### PART3B Use Docker Networks for React-Frontend Container (not needed)

- Previously in order to connect dockerized react-app to containerized node-app there was **no need to use** `http://host.docker.internal/goals/` so we had proceeded with `http://PUBLIC-IP/goals/`. React App will not be running on a container but on your browser which can communicate directly with the localhost of your system. Therefore `localhost` within app code will not refer to the host of the container itself but to the the host of your system. There's no need for additional resolution in this case, but you'll still need to publish the ports of node-backend container by `-p 80:80`

- Now in order to connect dockerized react-app to containerized node-app within same network, we are unable to use `container-name` because of the same reason. React App will not be running on a container but on your browser which can communicate directly with the localhost of your system.

- Therefore, not it's not even needed to place react-app container within network, since it is a browser side code. But, we'll need to publish a port for communication through local system which is the only way in order to connect dockerized react-app (whose JS will be running on browser) to containerized node-app.

```bash
$ docker build -t react-app-image .
## FULL-FINAL VERSION REACT-FRONTEND
$
docker run --name react-frontend \
-v $(pwd)/src:/home/node/app/src \
--rm -d \
-p 3000:3000 \
-it \
react-app-image
# --network fullstack-webapp-network \
```

### OPTIONAL Update for Development Environment

- Use `nodemon` for development environment of dockerized node-app (update package.json and Dockerfile )

```json

  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "nodemon app.js"
  },
  ...
  ...
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.4"
  }
}
```

- This is not needed for react environment as it's a built in feature.

# USING DOCKER COMPOSE

The Compose file provides a way to document and configure all of the application's service dependencies (databases, queues, caches, web service APIs, etc). Using the Compose command line tool you can create and start one or more containers for each dependency with a single command ( docker-compose up )

- **Creating Networks** is not mandatory as docker-compose creates another by default. If you add the 2nd, mongodb container will be added to special network as well. Names of services could be used in app code in order to to build connections.

- **volumes:** needs to be defined for making cluster being aware about named volumes. Different containers can use the same volume - same folder on your locad. Bind or anonymous named volumes can't be added here, indeed that's not even necessary

- **container names:** To replace autogenerated names by default such as foldername_mongodb_1, use `container_name: mongodb`

## PART3-A Docker-Compose for MongoDB Container

- Opt1 for environment variables: key value pairs create yaml object by default

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  mongodb:
    #to replace autogenerated names by default: foldername_mongodb_1
    container_name: mongodb
    image: "mongo"
    volumes:
      - data:/data/db
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: burak
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: unuvar
```

- Opt2 for environment variables : list of single values with dash

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  mongodb:
    # to replace autogenerated names by default: foldername_mongodb_1
    # container_name: mongodb
    image: "mongo"
    volumes:
      - data:/data/db
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=burak
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=unuvar
```

- Opt3 for environment variables: using a file

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  mongodb:
    # to replace autogenerated names by default: foldername_mongodb_1
    # container_name: mongodb
    image: "mongo"
    volumes:
      - data:/data/db
    env_file:
      - ./env/mongo-db.env
    networks:
      - fullstack-webapp-network
volumes:
  data:
```

## PART3-B Docker-Compose for Node-Backend Container

- Context should be set to /backend folder as we need to copy the whole folder into the image in this case

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  node-backend:
    build: ./backend
    # build:
    #   context: ./backend
    #   dockerfile: Dockerfile-dev
    #   args:
    #     some-arg: 1
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      # - "3000:80" it's also possible to list multiple ports
    volumes:
      - logs:/home/node/app/logs
      #relative path to docker-compose.yaml file
      - ./backend:/home/node/app
      - /home/node/app/node_modules
    env_file:
      - ./env/node-backend.env
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
volumes:
  logs:
```

## PART3-C Docker-Compose for React-Frontend Container

- interactive mode is required for dockerized react apps, thus we need to include `-it` flag

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  react-frontend:
    name: react-frontend
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend/src:/home/node/app/src
    stdin_open: true #i flag to open connection
    tty: true #t flag for attaching terminal
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

## Docker-Compose Commands

```bash
$ docker-compose up
$ docker-compose up -d
# automatically will be removed thus no need for -rm
$ docker-compose down
# in order to remove volumes
$ docker-compose down -v
# force to rebuild ( not to re-use prebuilt one )
$ docker-compose up --build
# to rebuild only custom images and then to run
$ docker-compose build
# there will be no re-built
$ docker-compose run
$ docker-compose --help
```

# USING MULTI-STAGE BUILDS

So far we've used the development server of react test environment which could be replaced with an NGINX server in production.

- Update Dockerfile for react-frontend (replace previous as Dockerfile-dev)

```Dockerfile
FROM node:alpine as builder
...
FROM nginx
COPY --from=builder /home/node/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```

- Update docker-compose to replace react-frontend by nginx-frontend

```yaml
nginx-frontend:
  container_name: nginx-frontend
  build: ./frontend
  ports:
    - "3000:80"
  depends_on:
    - node-backend
```
